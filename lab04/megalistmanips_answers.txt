1. In mapLoop, lw t1, 0(s0)
2. After that:
    slli t3, t0, 2      # counter*4 because 4-byte for each int
    add t4, t1, t3      # offset the array address by the count
3.  lw a0, 0(t4)        # load the value at that address into a0
4.  sw a0, 0(t4)        # store the returned value back into the array
5.  At the end
    lw a0, 8(s0)        # load the address of the next node into a0
    mv a1, s1           # put the address of the function back into a1 to prepare for the recursion
6.  In done: jr ra # to return.
